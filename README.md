# Dispatch
SLR.Dispatcher is a .NET library built to simplify in-process messaging. It provides a clean way to send commands and queries without the overhead of a full mediator stack. The goal is straightforward: a small, reliable dispatch engine that moves requests to the right handlers with as little ceremony as possible.
